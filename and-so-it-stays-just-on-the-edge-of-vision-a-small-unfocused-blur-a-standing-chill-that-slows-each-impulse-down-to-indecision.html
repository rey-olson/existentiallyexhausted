A friend lent me a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography)" rel="nofollow">Permanent Record</a> , Edward Snowden's autobiography.</div><div> </div><div>It's full with interesting information and often funny quotes. Here is a beautiful passage that stuck with me:</div><blockquote><div>To blank my posts from the face of the earth wasn't illegal and it wouldn't even have made me ineligible for a security clearance had anyone found out. But the prospect of doing so bothered me nonetheless. It would've only reinforced some of the most corrosive precepts of online life: that nobody is ever allowed to make a mistake, and anybody who does make a mistake must answer for it forever. What mattered to me wasn't so much the integrity of the written record but that of my soul. I didn't want to live in a world where everyone had to pretend that they were perfect, because that was a world that had no place for me or my friends. To erase those comments would have been to erase who I was, where I was from, and how far I'd come. To deny my younger self would have been to deny my present self's validity.</div><div> </div><div>I decided to leave the comments up and figure out to live with them. I even decided that true fidelity to this stance would require me to continue posting. In time, I'd outgrow these new opinions, too, but my initial impulse remains unshakable, if only because it was an important step in my own maturity. We can't erase the things that shame us, or the ways we've shamed ourselves, online. All we can do is control our reactions-whether we let the past oppress us, or accept its lessons, grow, and move on.</div></blockquote><p>Here is a (biased?) review of the book on <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2019/11/review-of-snowdens-book-permanent.html" rel="nofollow">Electrospaces.net</a>. </p><p><strong>Update 13 April 2021:<br></strong>I ordered a Dutch translation of the book (<a href="https://www.uitgeverijbalans.nl/boeken/onuitwisbaar/" rel="nofollow">"Onuitwisbaar"</a>) thinking I could finish the book quicker <em>and</em> because I wanted to own a copy myself, but I don't really like the translation as much as its original English counterpart.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://existentiallyexhausted.com/reading/">Reading</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gitlab Pages</a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://existentiallyexhausted.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
